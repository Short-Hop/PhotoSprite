# PhotoSprite

A deployed version of this site is available at: 
http://photosprite.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

PhotoSprite is a tool for converting images into pixel art.  You can log in to your google account in order to
make and save palettes and conversions.

The camera feature does not work on the deployed version because the site isn't https registered.
