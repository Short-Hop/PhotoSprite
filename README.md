# PhotoSprite

A deployed version of this site is available at: 
http://photosprite.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

PhotoSprite is a tool for converting images into pixel art.  You can log in to your google account in order to
save your palettes and conversions.

The camera feature does not work on the deployed version because the site isn't https registered.

I made this site as my Capstone project for a web development course.  The front end was build using React, with
state management implemented using react hooks.  The back end uses Node/Express to perform image conversion and to
save palettes and conversions.
